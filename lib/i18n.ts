Our sewing ministry, Coser Para Vivir, was born out of a vision to equip vulnerable women—single mothers, widows, migrants, and those seeking freedom from cycles of poverty and exploitation—with skills that restore dignity and open doors to a new future.\n\nWhat began in 2019 has now grown into a vibrant program where women are learning to sew with excellence, develop micro-business skills, and grow in confidence and faith. Coser Para Vivir is more than sewing classes. It\'s a safe place where women find community, discover their God-given worth, and experience spiritual renewal.\n\nEach graduate receives entrepreneurial training, along with a sewing machine and starter materials, empowering her to launch her own micro-business and provide for her family with dignity. As thousands across Latin America remain vulnerable to poverty and sex trafficking, programs like Coser Para Vivir stand as a tangible response—giving women a pathway out of risk and into purpose.\n\nVision Statement: "Teach sewing with excellence while empowering women to provide for their families, grow in confidence and faith, and live transformed lives for eternity."',

Mission Trips & Camp Teams\nJoin a short-term mission trip or serve with a summer camp team in Ecuador. Share life, faith, and encouragement with students, families, and local churches while experiencing God\'s family across cultures.\n\n2. Internships (Short-Term & Long-Term)\nWe offer programs for 3–6 months (a semester of service and language immersion) and 1–2 years (a deeper journey of growth and leadership development). Interns may also receive academic credit hours for their service.\n\n3. Gap Year Opportunities\nTake a purposeful pause before your next step in life. Whether between high school and college, or after graduation, a gap year allows you to serve, explore God\'s calling, and return home with renewed clarity and direction.\n\n4. Mentoring with Experience\nBaby boomers and retirees can use their professional skills and life experience to strengthen ministries and mentor younger leaders. Your wisdom and presence can leave a lasting legacy.\n\n5. Summer Routes (4–8 Weeks)\nThis is a focused opportunity for college students and young adults to grow while experiencing Ecuador. You can Teach your skills in community programs, Travel to explore the culture, and Transform yourself and the communities you serve.\n\nWhether for a week, a summer, or a year, Roots & Routes is about belonging to God\'s global family, serving with joy, and discovering the new routes God has prepared for your life.',

Every week, university students, young adults, professionals, children, and families gather here for a wide range of ministries — from English and music training to leadership development, discipleship groups, and community events.\n\nFor many who walk through our doors, CCC becomes the first safe and encouraging environment they have ever experienced. Students discover new academic and professional skills that can shape their future. Young adults wrestle with deep questions about identity, purpose, and faith — and find trusted leaders who walk with them. Children receive joy, attention, and belonging. And in every program, hearts are strengthened by the unmistakable experience of being known and loved.\n\nFor USA volunteers, CCC offers a front-row seat to God\'s transforming work in the next generation of Ecuador. Whether you teach English, mentor young adults, share professional skills, support music and worship, or simply help create a welcoming environment, your presence becomes part of a long-term, eternal story that God is writing in this community.\n\nAs you serve, you\'ll discover the beauty of true cross-cultural connection — friendships that last, conversations that matter, and moments where faith comes alive in fresh ways. At CrossWorlds, we believe "When Worlds Cross, Language Connects," and at CCC, the language of God\'s love speaks louder than anything else.\n\nCome join us as we equip students, strengthen families, disciple young leaders, and build a community where hope has a home — and where every act of service echoes into eternity.',

En CrossWorlds, nuestros programas de intercambio intercultural te invitan a descubrir ambos: encontrar tus raíces en Cristo y la comunidad, mientras caminas nuevas rutas de servicio, aprendizaje y amistad global.\n\nEl intercambio intercultural se trata de transformación mutua: las vidas cambian a medida que los participantes crecen en fe y perspectiva, y las comunidades locales son alentadas, fortalecidas y bendecidas a través de los dones y la presencia de quienes vienen a servir.\n\nOportunidades de Programa:\n\n1. Viajes Misioneros y Equipos de Campamento\nÚnete a un viaje misionero a corto plazo o sirve con un equipo de campamento de verano en Ecuador. Comparte vida, fe y aliento con estudiantes, familias e iglesias locales mientras experimentas la familia de Dios a través de las culturas.\n\n2. Pasantías (Corto y Largo Plazo)\nOfrecemos programas de 3–6 meses (un semestre de servicio e inmersión lingüística) y 1–2 años (un viaje más profundo de crecimiento y desarrollo de liderazgo). Los pasantes también pueden recibir créditos académicos por su servicio.\n\n3. Oportunidades de Año Sabático\nToma una pausa con propósito antes de tu próximo paso en la vida. Ya sea entre la secundaria y la universidad, o después de graduarte, un año sabático te permite servir, explorar el llamado de Dios y regresar a casa con mayor claridad y dirección.\n\n4. Mentoría con Experiencia\nLos baby boomers y jubilados pueden usar sus habilidades profesionales y experiencia de vida para fortalecer ministerios y mentorear líderes jóvenes. Tu sabiduría y presencia pueden dejar un legado duradero.\n\n5. Rutas de Verano (4–8 Semanas)\nEsta es una oportunidad enfocada para estudiantes universitarios y jóvenes adultos para crecer mientras experimentan Ecuador. Puedes Enseñar tus habilidades en programas comunitarios, Viajar para explorar la cultura, y Transformarte a ti mismo y a las comunidades que sirves.\n\nYa sea por una semana, un verano o un año, Raíces y Rutas se trata de pertenecer a la familia global de Dios, servir con alegría y descubrir las nuevas rutas que Dios ha preparado para tu vida.',

Cada semana, estudiantes universitarios, jóvenes adultos, profesionales, niños y familias se reúnen aquí para una amplia gama de ministerios — desde capacitación en inglés y música hasta desarrollo de liderazgo, grupos de discipulado y eventos comunitarios.\n\nPara muchos que atraviesan nuestras puertas, CCC se convierte en el primer ambiente seguro y alentador que han experimentado. Los estudiantes descubren nuevas habilidades académicas y profesionales que pueden moldear su futuro. Los jóvenes adultos luchan con preguntas profundas sobre identidad, propósito y fe — y encuentran líderes confiables que caminan con ellos. Los niños reciben alegría, atención y pertenencia. Y en cada programa, los corazones se fortalecen con la experiencia inconfundible de ser conocidos y amados.\n\nPara los voluntarios de EE.UU., CCC ofrece un asiento de primera fila para ver la obra transformadora de Dios en la próxima generación de Ecuador. Ya sea que enseñes inglés, mentorees jóvenes adultos, compartas habilidades profesionales, apoyes la música y la adoración, o simplemente ayudes a crear un ambiente acogedor, tu presencia se convierte en parte de una historia eterna a largo plazo que Dios está escribiendo en esta comunidad.\n\nAl servir, descubrirás la belleza de la verdadera conexión intercultural — amistades que perduran, conversaciones que importan y momentos donde la fe cobra vida de formas nuevas. En CrossWorlds, creemos que "Cuando los Mundos se Cruzan, el Lenguaje Conecta," y en CCC, el lenguaje del amor de Dios habla más fuerte que cualquier otra cosa.\n\nVen y únete a nosotros mientras equipamos estudiantes, fortalecemos familias, discipulamos jóvenes líderes y construimos una comunidad donde la esperanza tiene un hogar — y donde cada acto de servicio resuena en la eternidad.',
